# Ember Dependency Injection

I wrote this dependency Injection Framework to learn and to have a mental workout.

It is not thoroughly tested, has not a lot of features and might not be highly performant. It is public only because there is no reason not to have it public ðŸŽ‰

I intend to use it in hobby projects and will work on it occasionally, when I need a feature of find a bug. I'll try not to introduce breaking changes, but will make no promises. 

Enjoy!
