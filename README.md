# Fyremoss Dependency Injection

A C# dependency injection framework.

# Why?

I wrote this dependency injection framework to learn and to have a mental workout.

# Disclaimer

It is not thoroughly tested, has not a lot of features and might not be highly performant. It is public only because there is no reason not to have it public ðŸŽ‰

I intend to use it in hobby projects and will work on it occasionally, when I need a feature or find a bug. I'll try not to introduce breaking changes, but will make no promises. 

Enjoy!
